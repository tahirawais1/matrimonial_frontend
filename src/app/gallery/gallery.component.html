Our goal is to deter crime through the presence of our vehicle and the observation skills of our volunteers. We are the eyes and ears of the community. Our volunteers are trained to report emergencies in progress and undergo training to handle various incidents. Some of this training includes but isn't limited to CPR certification, crowd control training, and security certification. We coordinate and work with our local NYPD precincts to ensure the safety of the community.

        <p class="big-font"> For the past year and a half, the Cityline Ozone Park Civilian Patrol has run and operated
          the Ozone Park Food Pantry. Every Saturday, our volunteers distribute over $100 worth of fresh produce, dry
          goods, and canned goods to our community's over 800 families in need. The Food Pantry is held every Saturday
          at 83rd Street and Rockaway Blvd. We also host Pop-up pantries on select dates throughout the community to
          ensure we reach families in need.
